# DeFlyers
## This project is a Decentralized web3 application based on the ethereum technology.
### I. Concept:
This app is a decentralized aircraft exchange. I am developing this project to put it forward in my portfolio to work in the Blockchain / WEB3 space.
It is using simple mechanisms and some common tokens such as ERC-20 and ERC-721.
All mechanisms have been tested with Truffle and a deployment on testnets is planned. To avoid issues with testnets faucet (too much requests etc...) I have decided to create my own ERC-20 token: "Aureus" (AURS) which takes its name from the Roman currency. (Curiously Roman is also my name)
### II. Smart Contracts:
The architecture of the app's smart contracts is divided in 3 parts: the marketplace system, the ERC-20 token (currency), the ERC-721 token ("flyers" or the proof of ownership of an aircraft).
### III. Website:
The app is a 2-page website using Vue JS. For the moment all the pictures are saved server-side (locally at the moment as I have not deployed the website yet) but I will consider using NFT-storage or IPFS to store images to be able to publish the website on github pages without worrying about server-side behavior.
